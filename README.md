# 📊 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis & Visualization Project
This project explores the global spread and impact of COVID-19 using a cleaned time-series dataset. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insightful visualizations to uncover trends in confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases across multiple countries.

✅ Key Features
Cleaned and transformed dataset with 49,000+ records across 180+ countries

📅 Time-series analysis of daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases

📈 Line plots, heatmaps, area charts, stacked bar graphs, pie charts, and correlation plots

🌍 Country-level comparison (India, US, Brazil, etc.)

🔥 Weekly growth rate analysis and recovery-vs-death correlations


🛠 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)


Dataset Source: covid_19_clean_complete.csv (from Kaggle)

📌 Project Goals
Visual storytelling of the pandemic’s evolution

Comparative analysis of country-wise COVID-19 responses

Showcase of practical data analysis, EDA, and visualization skills
